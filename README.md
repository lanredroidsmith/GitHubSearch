# GitHub Search
GitHub Search is a simple app to showcase some of the commonly used APIs in the Android Framework. APIs such as Content Providers, Shared Preferences, Fragments (for modularity and good use of space on tablets), etc. Data binding techniques were also used to show MVVM architecture.

It provides users with the ability to search for software developers and repositories with a number of criteria using the popular [GitHub Search APIs](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/). Presently, users can only search for developers. Repository search will be added later, hopefully soon. Users can mark developers as favorites making their info available even while the user is offline. Users can add some commonly-used search criteria as preferences.

Packaging (of classes) was done by feature, so as to ease navigation while developing and also to ease project maintainability.

[Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io) were also followed.
